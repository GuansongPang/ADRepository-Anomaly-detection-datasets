Anomaly detection on time series data is one of the most active research directions in the anomaly detection community.

Some commonly-used datasets are as follows:  
- ASD   https://github.com/zhhlee/InterFusion  
- SMD   https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly  
- SWAT  https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets  
- WaQ   https://www.spotseven.de/gecco/gecco-challenge  
- DSADS https://github.com/zhangyuxin621/AMSL  
- Epilepsy https://github.com/boschresearch/NeuTraL-AD/  

These datasets are from the paper below; check the paper for more detail.
