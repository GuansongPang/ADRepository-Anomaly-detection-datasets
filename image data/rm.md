Below are the links to access 9 publicly available image datasets with real anomalies from diverse application domains are used. These include five benchmarks for identifying visual defects or micro-cracks on different object surfaces: MVTec AD\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/mvtecad}}, AITEX\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/aitex-defect}}, SDD\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/KolektorSDD}}, ELPV\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/elpv-crack}}, and Optical\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/optical-defect}}; a benchmark for detecting novel observations from large-scale observations on the surface of planets (such as Mars) in rover-based planetary exploration: Mastcam\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/mastcam}}; and three medical imaging benchmarks for detecting lesions on colonoscopy/MRI/CT images: Hyper-Kvasir\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/hyper-kvasir}}, BrainMRI\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/brainMRI-tumor}}, and HeadCT\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/headCT-tumor}}.
