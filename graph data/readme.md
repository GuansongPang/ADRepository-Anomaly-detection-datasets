# Graph datasets
Graph anomaly detection may include the detection of abnormal nodes, edges, or graphs. This repository collects relevant datasets for these tasks.

## Graph-level anomaly detection
Below are sixteen publicly available real-world graph-level anomaly detection datasets used by GLocalKD, a method published in WSDM'22 and released at https://github.com/RongrongMa/GLocalKD. The basic 
statistics of the datasets are given in the table below. To download the datasets, please refer to the GLocalKD repository.
