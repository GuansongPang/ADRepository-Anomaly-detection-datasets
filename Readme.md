# ADRepository: Real-world anomaly detection datasets

In this repository, we provide a continuously updated collection of popular real-world datasets used for anomaly detection in the literature. Some of the datasets are converted from imbalanced classification datasets, while the others contain real anomalies.

This repository is created to serve as an extension to the datasets presented in our recent survey paper on deep anomaly detection. If you use the datasets below, you may cite the survey paper or the specific papers in the following sections to acknowledge the use.

## Video Datasets
Two popular weakly supervised video anomaly detection datasets, including ShanghaiTech Campus and UCF-Crime, are added to the [video data](https://github.com/GuansongPang/anomaly-detection-datasets/tree/main/video%20data) folder. The sources are features extracted using I3D backbone rather than raw data. Weakly supervised video anomaly detection assumes the availability of the video-level labels and aims at detecting frame-level anomalies. They can also be re-organized and used for semi-supervised settings that the training data contains normal videos only. More information about the datasets can be found in the following papers.

## Image Datasets
We add 14 publicly available image datasets with real anomalies from diverse application domains, including **defect detection**, **novelty detection** in rover-based planetary exploration, **lesion detection** in medical images, and **anomaly segmentation** in autonomous driving scenes. See [image data](https://github.com/GuansongPang/anomaly-detection-datasets/tree/main/image%20data) for more details. These datasets are used to evaluate a wide range of detection models in different settings (e.g., **open-set anomaly detection** and **out-of-distribution semantic segmentation**) in the following paper:

## Time Series Datasets

Anomaly detection on time series data is one of the most active research directions in the anomaly detection community. Some commonly-used datasets are as follows:  
- ASD   https://github.com/zhhlee/InterFusion  
- SMD   https://github.com/NetManAIOps/OmniAnomaly  
- SWAT  https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets  
- WaQ   https://www.spotseven.de/gecco/gecco-challenge  
- DSADS https://github.com/zhangyuxin621/AMSL  
- Epilepsy https://github.com/boschresearch/NeuTraL-AD/  

These datasets are from the paper below; check the paper for more detail.

```

There are some concerns on the use of these popular datasets. Check out the below paper for more detail.
